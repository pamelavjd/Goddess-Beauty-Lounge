		        <h5 class="card-title">Application</h5>
		        <p class="card-text">The process of applying lash extensions is important. It is essential to isolate each natural lash before applying the extension. The extension is then chosen from the lash tray. Then, it is dipped in the adhesive. Getting the right amount of glue is critical. Too much means risking gluing lashes together, and too little means they may not adhere properly. Then the extension is adhered to your natural lash. Position is also important, making sure that the lash doesn’t settle at an unwanted angle.</p>

		        <h5 class="card-title">Thickness</h5>
		        <p class="card-text">Eyelash extensions are created with different diameters for different purposes. Avoid anything that is too thick. 0.20 mm or 0.25 mm are just too much for most lashes to handle. The most common thicknesses for classic -style lashes is 0.15 mm.  0.10 mm can be used on very fine lashes or can be placed with another 0.10 mm to create a volume dimensional effect. 0.07 mm, 0.06 mm, and 0.05 mm thicknesses are used for volume lashes and 0.03m are used for Mega-volume. In the end, choose the appropriate style that fits you best.</p>

		        <p class="card-text">Some of the most common Most common styles include: cat eye, doll eye, and dramatic. Cat eye draws the eye out with length at the ends making the eye look more almond shaped. Doll eye puts the majority of length in the middle, where it opens up the eye for a larger look, which often looks the most natural. Dramatic leaves lots of length throughout for a more glam-style look.</p>

		        <h5 class="card-title">Curl & Lenght</h5>
		        <p class="card-text">Some represent eyelash curls with letters. For example, a “J” curl is obviously more of “J” shape and is the least curly or lifted. “B” curl is a basic curl. “C” curl is the common curl that matches most people natural lash curl. “D” curl is the most dramatic and lifted, it will be the most visible from the front.  “L” curl has a harsher “L” shape, being  a great option for when the “D” curl just isn’t enough.<br>
				Length is largely decided by the length of your natural lashes. We advise not to go for too much length. It may cause lashes to not last as long or detach. We understand that everybody loves length, so if you prefer them long,  opt for a volume set that consists of more, finer lashes.
				If you wear glasses, prevent rubbing against your lens by not surpassing 12mm in length.  </p>

		        <h5 class="card-title">Aftercare</h5>
		        <p class="card-text">No water contact, steam or saunas for the first 24 hours
				When showering, avoid letting water from your shower head run directly onto your lashes
				Avoid getting wet excessively, gently pat dry (don't let air dry)
				Avoid hot steam (including facials)
				Absolutely no mascara or eyelash curlers
				Use all oil-free products. No oily products on or around the eye area as oil can break down the bond and cause them to slip off
				Clean your lashes 2-3 times a week with Foaming Lash Cleanser so the dirt, dead skin cell,oil buildup don't accumulate and to reduce risk from building bacteria and blepharitis.
				Gently remove makeup with an oil free makeup remover or cleanser, especially prior to coming in for a fill
				Use lint free products to remove makeup around the eye
				Brush and groom your lashes every morning and after showers with a dry mascara wand to maintain growth
				Sleep on your back or on your side with lashes off the pillow, do not sleep on your face
				Do not pull or tug on the extensions, treat your lashes with love
				It is normal to lose 2-5 lashes a day but by following these rules you will extend the length of having fuller looking lashes</p>
